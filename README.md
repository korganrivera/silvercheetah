# SILVERCHEETAH
This is a tool I use to process .csv files generated by the Wahoo Fitness app while using the Kinetic trainer.

Silvercheetah can do the following:
* scan a folder for new Wahoo csv files
* strip speed values from each file
* calculate FTP and TSS from speed values
* write these to tss.log

Silvercheetah then processes tss.log to do the following:
* calculate CTL (fitness)
* calculate ATL (fatigue)
* calculate TSB (freshness)

I've set my Wahoo Fitness app to share csv files to a folder in Dropbox.

Silvercheetah can be set to run with inotify or cron.
tss.log can be displayed using gnuplot if you want.
