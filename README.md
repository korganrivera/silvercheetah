# SILVERCHEETAH
This is a tool I use to process .csv files generated by the Wahoo Fitness app while using the Kinetic trainer.

Silvercheetah can do the following:
* scan a folder for new Wahoo csv files
* strip speed values from each file
* calculate FTP and TSS from speed values
* write these to tss.log

Silvercheetah then processes tss.log to do the following:
* calculate CTL (fitness)
* calculate ATL (fatigue)
* calculate TSB (freshness)

I've set my Wahoo Fitness app to share csv files to a folder in Dropbox.

Silvercheetah can be set to run with inotify or cron.

tss.log can be displayed using gnuplot if you want.

## HOW TO USE
The default folder for your wahoo csv files is ./wahoo_csv_files
If it doesn't exist, create it.
put some wahoo csv files in there.
run `./silvercheetah`
Files found in there will be processed and tss.log will be created

### What if I want to use a different folder?
* Put the folder path on the first line of the config file, no trailing slash. For example, `~/Dropbox/wahoo_files`
* If .files_old and tss.log exist, delete them.
* Run `./silvercheetah`
* Files found in there will be processed and a new tss.log will be created.
* If you change the default folder, you can delete the wahoo_csv_files folder if you want.
