# SILVERCHEETAH
This is a tool I use to process .csv files generated by the Wahoo Fitness app while using the Kinetic trainer.

__To-do list__:
-  [x] strip the speed values from the .csv file,
-  [x] calculate AP
-  [x] calculate NP
-  [x] calculate FTP
-  [x] calculate IF
-  [x] calculate TSS
-  [x] log the timestamped tss and ftp values in a log file.

 __For those values in the log file, it will__:
-  [ ] calculate CTL (fitness)
-  [ ] calculate ATL (fatigue)
-  [ ] calculate TSB (freshness)

Wahoo shares .csv files to a folder in Dropbox. I want to set silvercheetah as a cron job to scan that folder for new files.

Once the above tasks are done, silvercheetah will be able to recommend a TSS range to work on for that day. If you know how much fatigue you can tolerate, you can work out the maximum TSS you can handle that day without risking burnout.

I think this might be a job for sql, but for now I'm going to do it the ugly way with simple textfiles.

If I can display an attractive graph of both the first set of values calculated for the
ride and the values in the log file, then that would be pretty sweet too.

__Code to-do list__:
-  [ ] c0ontingency for large number overflow.
-  [ ] rewrite that EOF check loop.
-  [ ] refactor all the things.
